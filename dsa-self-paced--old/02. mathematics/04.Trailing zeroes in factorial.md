> first calculation factorial and then counting zeros is not feasible for large numbers as they can be stored in long, int.

```cpp
// User function Template for C++
class Solution {
  public:
    int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int total5s=0;
        for(int i=5;i<=n;i*=5){
            total5s+=n/i;
        }
        return total5s;
    }
