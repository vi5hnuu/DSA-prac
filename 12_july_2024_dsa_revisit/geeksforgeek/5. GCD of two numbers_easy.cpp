The fundamental property of the Euclidean algorithm is:

**GCD(a, b) = GCD(a - b, b)**

### Why does this work?
1. Let **d** be the GCD of `a` and `b`, meaning:
   - `d` divides `a`
   - `d` divides `b`

2. Since **d** divides both `a` and `b`, it must also divide their difference:

   `d` divides `(a - b)`

3. This means **d** is also a divisor of `(a - b, b)`, proving that:

   `GCD(a, b) = GCD(a - b, b)`

### Example:
Find `GCD(48, 18)` using `GCD(a - b, b)`:

1. `GCD(48, 18) = GCD(48 - 18, 18) = GCD(30, 18)`
2. `GCD(30, 18) = GCD(30 - 18, 18) = GCD(12, 18)`
3. `GCD(12, 18) = GCD(18 - 12, 12) = GCD(6, 12)`
4. `GCD(6, 12) = GCD(12 - 6, 6) = GCD(6, 6)`
5. `GCD(6, 6) = 6`

Thus, **GCD(48, 18) = 6**.

This property forms the basis of the **Euclidean Algorithm**, which is optimized using modulo:
**GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a % b)**

### Why Does `GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a % b)` Work?  

We need to prove that replacing `a` with `a % b` does not change the **GCD**.  

---

### Step 1: Understanding What GCD Means  
- The **GCD** of two numbers `a` and `b` is the largest number that divides both `a` and `b`.  
- Suppose `g` is the **GCD of `a` and `b`**, meaning:  
  - `g` divides `a`  
  - `g` divides `b`  
  - `g` is the **largest** such number.  

---

### Step 2: Expressing `a % b` Mathematically  
When we divide `a` by `b`, we get:  

`a = q * b + r`  

where:  
- `q` is the quotient (how many times `b` fits in `a`)  
- `r` is the remainder (`a % b`), which is **always smaller than `b`**  

So, we can rewrite `GCD(a, b)` as:  

`GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, r)`  

where `r = a % b`.  

---

### Step 3: Why Does This Preserve the GCD?  
We need to show that **`GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a % b)`**, meaning they have the same greatest common divisor.  

#### 1. Any number that divides both `a` and `b` also divides `r`  
- If `g` divides `a` and `b`, then `g` must also divide **any linear combination** of `a` and `b`.  
- Since `r = a - q * b`, and `g` divides both `a` and `b`, it **must also divide `r`**.  

#### 2. Any number that divides `b` and `r` also divides `a`  
- If some number divides both `b` and `r`, it must also divide:  

  `a = q * b + r`  

  because `a` is just a sum of multiples of `b` and `r`.  

- So, the set of common divisors of `(a, b)` is the same as the set of common divisors of `(b, r)`, meaning:  

  `GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, r)`.  

---

### Step 4: Example to See It in Action  
Let's find `GCD(48, 18)` using the modulo method:  

1. Compute `48 % 18 = 12`  
   `GCD(48, 18) = GCD(18, 12)`  

2. Compute `18 % 12 = 6`  
   `GCD(18, 12) = GCD(12, 6)`  

3. Compute `12 % 6 = 0`  
   `GCD(12, 6) = GCD(6, 0)`  

4. Since `b = 0`, the answer is **6**.  

---

### Step 5: Why is This Faster Than Subtraction?  
Instead of repeatedly subtracting `b` from `a`, we **directly jump to the remainder**, which reduces the size of the problem much faster. This gives the algorithm a **logarithmic time complexity**:  

`O(log(min(a, b)))`  

---

### Conclusion  
The modulo version of the Euclidean Algorithm works because:  
1. The remainder `a % b` preserves all common divisors.  
2. The GCD does not change when replacing `a` with `a % b`.  
3. The algorithm quickly reduces the problem size, making it efficient.
